/home/labs/nyosef/eitangr/miniconda3/envs/pixelgen-scvi-1/lib/python3.11/multiprocessing/popen_fork.py:66: RuntimeWarning: Using fork() can cause Polars to deadlock in the child process.
In addition, using fork() with Python in general is a recipe for mysterious
deadlocks and crashes.

The most likely reason you are seeing this error is because you are using the
multiprocessing module on Linux, which uses fork() by default. This will be
fixed in Python 3.14. Until then, you want to use the "spawn" context instead.

See https://docs.pola.rs/user-guide/misc/multiprocessing/ for details.

If you really know what your doing, you can silence this warning with the warning module
or by setting POLARS_ALLOW_FORKING_THREAD=1.
